# College-Statistics-Work
Some examples of work I completed (both alone and in groups) while in statistics courses at Roanoke College

The body project is a project I completed with a partner that attempted to find the best possible way to predict someone's weight based on certain body features.

The lax project is another partner project that looked at the shot data of the Roanoke College men's and women's lacrosse teams. The goal was to see if the value of the shot differed by gender.

Test 2 used random data that observed the effect of new medication on patients using a health indicator variable. The goal was to see if the new medication had any kind of effect on patients. The HTML file is more technical than the others, but does have a simpler explanation at the very bottom.

The Final project is broken down into two separate parts. The first part looked at the Chesapeake Bay and the rivers associated with it to determine if light attenuation of the water could be explained by a number of variables. The second part looked American football data, specifically the kickers in both leagues. The goal was to determine if there was a difference in the probability of making a field goal depending on the league.
